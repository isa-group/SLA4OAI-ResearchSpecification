# SLA for Open API Initiative Specification

The goal of the [SLA4OAI Specification](./Specification.md) is to define a standard which allows to write
services level agreement over REST APIs which are defined via [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).  This specification describes the format for defining SLAs over APIs in a neutral technology way.

In order to validate the specification a [Basic SLA Management Service](./operationalServices.md) is proposed which offers a way to implement the services that control, manage, report and track SLAs.

This GitHub project is the starting point for SLA4OAI. Here you will find the information you need about the SLA4OAI Specification, a simple static sample of what it looks like, and some general information regarding the project.

## Current Version - 0.9.1

The current version of the SLA4OAI Specification is 0.9.1 and you can find it [here](./Specification.md)

The current version of the Basic SLA Management Service is 0.7.1 and you can find it [here](./operationalServices.md)
